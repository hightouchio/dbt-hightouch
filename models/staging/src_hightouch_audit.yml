    tables:
      - name: sync_changelog
        description: |
          This table contains a row for every operation performed by Hightouch.
          It includes the result of the operation, as well as any error messages from syncing.
        columns:
          - name: sync_id
            description: The id of the sync
          - name: sync_run_id
            description: The id of the sync run
          - name: row_id
            description: The value of the row's primary key as defined from the model.
          - name: op_type
            description: |
              Whether the row was added, changed, or removed relative to the last
              run. This is computed by Hightouch when planning the sync run.
              Note, that just because a row was removed from the previous run
              does not mean the record was removed from a destination.
          - name: status
            description: |
              Whether the row was successfully synced into destination. The value
              may be succeeded (the row was successfully synced), failed
              (Hightouch attempted to sync the row, but it failed to sync), and
              aborted (Hightouch planned to sync the row, but did not attempt to
              sync. This may happen if the sync may have been cancelled, or the
              sync encountered a fatal error that terminated the run early).
          - name: failure_reason
            description: |
              If the status is failed, this will contain a string describing why the row failed to sync.
          - name: fields
            description: |
              A JSON object of the raw data from the model that is being synced
              into destination. Note that this is the raw data from the
              warehouse, not the payload that Hightouch sent to the destination.
              This column is not supported on Redshift.

      - name: sync_runs
        description: |
          This table contains a log of all the sync runs. The changelog and
          snapshot tables can be JOINed to this table for more information on
          when the sync occurred, and how it was configured.

            description:
              The status of the sync run. The will be either succeeded
              or failed. In general, the per-row results of the sync are a better
              indication of status.

          This table contains the latest status of each row in your model. The
          information is very similar to the sync_changelog table, but is easier
